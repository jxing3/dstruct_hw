divide by zero
get rid of both operands

not enough operands, pop the one back


why we double array- every time we insert a value we have to copy 
everything over again

amortized doubling 

o(n) insertions-pay this less and less over time plus o(1) insertions

becomes rarer and rarer that you have to do a full copy

"amortized o(1)"- specific opertation may be o(n), averaged over many,
they are o(1) 

amortized- can sometimes by O(1)

memory allocation is very expensive

make array look like a loop for queue

have a front and a back that gets modded to find actual place

only use mods for positive numbers

always add length of the array to mod

size field?
