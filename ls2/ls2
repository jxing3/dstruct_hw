Data
====

type of data (properties <=[])-> data structure (properties)-> algorithms

For N books names with <=k characters

names = unsorted- search linear- N

names < sorted- search binary - log N

names [] (char by char)- trie - k

Java Review
==========

    Packages- units you can organize code
      ||                  ||
   Classes            Interfaces
     ||
(data)variables/
basic types  int, char, double
(value semantics (int a =10, int b =a, a =7, assert b==10-true))

reference types class interface, string
(reference semantics (x a = new x(); x b = a; a.f = 7, assert b.f ==7;)  (both point to same object)

(code)methods
  if while switch
  exp, (!for each)

packages

-java.util

-java.io

class within a class- nested classes (inner classes)

inheritance (a->b)

class extends 1 class (only one)

interface
========

class implements n interfaces

                   ||
combination of signatures

signature (name, parameters, and return type of a method (NO CODE))

interface -gives the what

class - how you do it (methods)

Application
==========

will talk to interface called bookstore-(uses three different classes 
that implements it-changes behavior)

most reuse happens with interface

interface polymorphism- application use interface can contact with multiple different classes

cover -> generics, exceptions, nested classes, ...

Counter
======

something that goes up (doesn't matter how)

interface (counter is a display and button)

implementation

specification
