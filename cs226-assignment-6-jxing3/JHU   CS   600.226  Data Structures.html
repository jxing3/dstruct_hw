<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
 The sixth assignment is all about trees, and the trees are full
 of files (and directories)!

 You'll implement a general n-ary tree following the interface we
 designed in lecture, but you're free to pick your
 <strong>representation</strong>
 of the tree in <strong>any</strong> way that fulfills the interface.

 You'll also use your tree implementation to develop a simulation
 of a simple Unix-like file system.

 You'll need to grab
 <a href="http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/2013/fall/cs226/src/trees.tar.gz">this archive</a>
 for interfaces and exception classes.

 Maybe you want to take a quick tour of the files
 before you read on?
</p>

<h3>Problem 1: Tree Implementation (60%)</h3>

<p>
 Your first task for this assignment is to develop an efficient
 implementation of the 
 <code>Tree&lt;T&gt;</code>
 interface for general n-ary trees (see archive above).

 The interface follows our design from lecture rather closely,
 with just a few minor differences.

 Obviously you'll also have to implement the
 <code>Position&lt;T&gt;</code>
 interface; as before, the class you write for this
 purpose should be <strong>nested</strong> inside
 your tree implementation.

 Furthermore you <strong>must</strong> use (and you
 <strong>may</strong> have to implement, see below)
 the Java interfaces
 <code>java.util.Iterator&lt;T&gt;</code>
 and
 <code>java.lang.Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code>
 since they are part of our
 <code>Tree&lt;T&gt;</code>
 interface as well.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Please name your class implementing our interface
 <code>TreeImplementation&lt;T&gt;</code> and put it into a
 file called <code>TreeImplementation.java</code> for this
 assignment!</strong>
</p>

<p>
 The reason why we stray from our usual naming scheme is that
 we will allow you a <strong>lot</strong> more freedom in
 choosing your exact tree representation. (Our usual naming
 convention uses the implementation technique as part of the
 class name, but without a proscribed representation that's
 not feasible.)

 For example, it's up to you whether you want to implement
 <code>Node&lt;T&gt;</code> objects that <strong>really</strong>
 store an <strong>arbitrary number of child pointers</strong>
 or if you'd rather use the <strong>left child-right sibling</strong>
 encoding that represents n-ary trees using nodes with
 a <strong>fixed</strong> number of pointers.

 Furthermore you are allowed to use the Java collection
 classes
 <code>java.util.ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</code>
 and
 <code>java.util.LinkedList&lt;T&gt;</code>
 if you would like to.

 Since you have to <strong>somehow</strong> implement various
 <code>java.util.Iterator&lt;T&gt;</code>
 and
 <code>java.lang.Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code>
 things, this may indeed reduce your work quite
 a bit (the Java classes <strong>already</strong> support those
 interfaces).
</p>

<p>
 You should provide a <code>toString()</code> method
 in addition to the methods required by the
 <code>Tree&lt;T&gt;</code>
 interface.

 The string you return should list the elements of the tree as
 they would be processed during a <strong>pre-order</strong>
 traversal, otherwise the format is similar to previous
 assignments.

 For example,
 <code>[]</code> is the empty tree and <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>
 is the tree with <code>1</code> at the root and <code>2</code>
 "before" <code>3</code> in <code>1</code>'s list of children.
</p>

<p>
 Your <code>TreeImplementation&lt;T&gt;</code> class should come
 with a full suite of JUnit 4 test cases <strong>using
 theories</strong> in a file <code>TestTree.java</code>.

 Be sure to test <strong>all</strong> methods and be sure
 to test <strong>all</strong> exceptions for error situations
 as well.
</p>

<h3>Problem 2: File System Simulation (40%)</h3>

<p>
 Your second task for this assignment is to write a simple
 file system simulation called <code>DOS.java</code> (for
 the obvious historical reasons).

 You will use a
 <code>Tree&lt;T&gt;</code>
 to keep track of the layout of a simple file system in which
 all entries are either <strong>files</strong> or
 <strong>directories</strong>.

 The initial tree has a single directory called <code>/</code>
 (that's simply a slash character) as its root, and the initial
 position inside the file system (our "current directory")
 is the corresponding node in the tree.

 The user can issue the following commands to interact with the
 simulation (where "name" stands for any sequence of the upper-case
 and lower-case letters; the only "special" name is ".." for the
 parent directory):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
   <code>ls</code>:
   print the names of all entries (files and directories)
   in the current directory, in alphabetical order; for
   directories, print a "/" character at the end of the
   actual name
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>cd name</code>:
   make "name" (which must be a directory) the current directory;
   if name is ".." go up to the parent directory of the current
   directory; the parent of <code>/</code> is <code>/</code> (as
   in Unix); it's an error to <code>cd</code> into a non-existant
   directory or into a file
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>mkdir name</code>: 
   create a directory called "name" in the current directory; it's
   an error to create a directory with the name of an existing
   entry
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>rmdir name</code>: 
   remove a directory called "name" from the current directory;
   it's an error to remove a non-empty directory; it's an error
   to remove a file with this command; it's an error if no directory
   "name" exists
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>mk name</code>: 
   create a file called "name" in the current directory; it's
   an error to create a file with the name of an existing entry
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>rm name</code>: 
   remove a file called "name" from the current directory;
   it's an error to remove a directory with this command;
   it's an error if no file "name" exists
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>pwd</code>: 
   print the <strong>absolute path</strong> to the current working
   directory (see below for an example)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>quit</code>: 
   exit the program, stop the simulation
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Here is a sample interaction with the simulation; note the
 <code>&gt;</code> prompts to enter a command and the format
 of the error messages:
</p>

<pre>&gt; ls
&gt; pwd
/
&gt; cd ..
&gt; pwd
/
&gt; mkdir tst
&gt; ls
tst/
&gt; mkdir bla
&gt; ls
bla/
tst/
&gt; rm bla
? error: bla is a directory, use rmdir instead
&gt; rmdir bla
&gt; ls
tst/
&gt; cd tst
&gt; pwd
/tst
&gt; ls
&gt; mk bla
&gt; ls
bla
&gt; mkdir hey
&gt; ls
bla
hey/
&gt; cd hey
&gt; pwd
/tst/hey
&gt; quit
</pre>

<p>
 You will have to make quite a few design decisions by yourself
 to make this work.

 You should probably write classes
 <code>Entry</code>, <code>File</code>, and <code>Directory</code>,
 all of which you store
 inside a <code>Tree&lt;Entry&gt;</code> for the simulation...

 Good luck!
</p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<p>
 Please turn in a
 <a href="http://www.gzip.org/"><code>gzip</code></a>
 compressed
 <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/tarball.html">tarball</a>
 of your assignment;
 the filename should be
 <code>cs226-assignment-6-<em>name</em>.tar.gz</code>
 with <code><em>name</em></code> replaced by the first part of the
 email address you used to register on <a href="http://piazza.com/">Piazza</a>
 (so I would use <code>cs226-assignment-6-phf.tar.gz</code>).

 The tarball should contain <strong>no</strong> derived files whatsoever
 (i.e. no <code>.class</code> files, no <code>.html</code> files, etc.),
 but allow building <strong>all</strong> derived files.

 Include a <code>README</code> file that briefly explains what your
 programs do and contains any other notes you want us to check out
 before grading; your answers to <strong>written</strong> problems
 should be in this file as well.
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
For reference, here is a short explanation of the grading criteria;
some of the criteria don't apply to all problems, and not all of the
criteria are used on all assignments.

<strong>Packaging</strong> refers to the proper organization of the
stuff you hand in, following both the guidelines for Deliverables
above as well as the general submission instructions for assignments.

<strong>Style</strong> refers to Java programming style, including
things like consistent indentation, appropriate identifier names,
useful comments, suitable <code>javadoc</code> documentation, etc.
as enforced by <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net/">checkstyle</a>
with our <a href="http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/jhu_checks.xml">JHU configuration file</a>.
Style also includes proper modularization of your code (into
interfaces, classes, methods, and using public, protected, and
private appropriately).
Simple, clean, readable code is what you should be aiming for.

<strong>Testing</strong> refers to proper unit tests for all of
the data structure classes you developed for this assignment,
using the <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit 4</a> framework.
Make sure you test <strong>all</strong> (implied) axioms that
you can think of and <strong>all</strong> exception conditions
that are relevant.

<strong>Performance</strong> refers to how fast/with how little
memory your program can produce the required results compared to
other submissions.

<strong>Functionality</strong> refers to your programs being
able to do what they should according to the specification
given above; if the specification is ambiguous and you had
to make a certain choice, defend that choice in your
<code>README</code> file.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
If your programs cannot be built you will get no points whatsoever.

If your programs cannot be built without warnings using
<code>javac -Xlint:all</code>
we will take off 10% (except if you document a very good reason).

If your programs fail miserably even once,
i.e. terminate with an exception of any kind,
we will take off 10% (however we'll also take those 10% off if
you're trying to be smart by wrapping your whole program into
a universal try-catch).

Finally, make sure to include your name and email address in
every file you turn in (well, in every file for which it makes
sense anyway)!
