Problem 1

TreeImplementation.java implements the tree interface using nodes that 
store their children in an arralist. Test cases were written in TestTree.java
to ensure the implementation operated accordingly with the interface. Overall,
I thought the interface had some redundancies in it, especially with operations
like hasParent and isRoot. The only valid node without a parent is the root,
so it made no sense to have both operations. Also, It might have been useful to
have different interators that runs through the tree pre order, in order,
and post order.

Problem 2

DOS.java is a simple file system simulation. Everything was implemented
according to the specifications provided. I utilized an entry class and 
subclasses directory and file to keep track and distinguish between 
entries. It was somewhat difficult to modularize the code to pass
the cyclomatic complexity, but I was ultimately able to do it by breaking
seperate operations into different pieces of code.
