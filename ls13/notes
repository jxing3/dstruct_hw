we don't care about what we put in...just where it is

eveything is happening with positions

list - boxes with out w/o neighbors- no boxes is also a list- empty list

operations

new
empty
insertBack
insertFront
removeFront
removeBack

remove: List<T> x Position<T> -> List<T>

insertBefore:
insertAfter

array- get an integer at constant time


takes forever with integer position

we want everything to be private so no one can write code
regarding nodes- you can't change ur code anymore

you're handing them a node, they just don't know
