priority queue

queue cares about values in the queue

makes it so smallest values come out first

same for max - but different implementation

not a set- it's a queue

queue semantics 

interface

insert
remove- removes highest priority item
empty
top - return highest priority item

implementing priority queue

sorted, linked list?

insert O(n) - can't do random accesss

top - O(1)

remove - O(1)

sorted array

O(n) - become have to move elements out of the way

top - O(1)

remove - O(n) ???

binary heap

o(log(n))

o(1)

o(log(n))

binary heap is a binary tree

shape property

heap needs to be full eexcept for last level

ordering property

children are greater parents are smaller
