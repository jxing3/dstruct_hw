<h2>Assignment 5: Linked Lists</h2>

<p>
<strong>Out on:</strong>
October 4, 2013
<br>
<strong>Due by:</strong>
October 11, 2013 before 10:00 pm
<br>
<strong>Collaboration:</strong>
None
<br>
<strong>Grading:</strong>
Packaging 10%,
Style 10% (where applicable),
Testing 20% (where applicable),
Performance 10% (where applicable),
Functionality 50% (where applicable)
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
The fifth assignment is mostly about the list implementation
using sentinels that we discussed in lecture.

I was going to include an application as well, but seeing as
you have the midterm to deal with, I wanted to make sure that
this is a shorter assignment instead.

You'll need to grab
<a href="http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/2013/fall/cs226/src/lists.tar.gz">this archive</a>
for interfaces and exception classes.

Maybe you want to take a quick tour of the files
before you read on?
</p>

<h3>Problem 1: List Implementation (90%)</h3>

<p>
 Your first task for this assignment is to write a generic
 linked list class <code>SentinelList&lt;T&gt;</code> that
 implements all of the interfaces we designed in lecture:
 <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>,
 <code>Position&lt;T&gt;</code>,
 and
 <code>Iterator&lt;T&gt;</code>.

 Unlike the
 <code>NodeList&lt;T&gt;</code>
 implementation that we hacked in lecture, your
 <code>SentinelList&lt;T&gt;</code>
 will use the <strong>sentinel nodes</strong> technique
 to further simplify the code for most list operations.
 
 You will still be able to <strong>reuse</strong> a large
 part of the code from lecture, and you're allowed to do so.
 Please remember that your implementations of the
 <code>Position&lt;T&gt;</code>
 and
 <code>Iterator&lt;T&gt;</code>
 interfaces should both be <strong>nested</strong> inside
 your
 <code>SentinelList&lt;T&gt;</code>
 class.
</p>

<p>
 You should provide a <code>toString()</code> method
 in addition to the methods required by the
 <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>
 interface.

 A new list into which 1, 2, and 3 were inserted using
 <code>insertBack()</code> should print as
 <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> while an empty list should print
 as <code>[]</code>.
</p>

<p>
 Your <code>SentinelList&lt;T&gt;</code> class should come
 with a full suite of JUnit 4 test cases <strong>using
 theories</strong> in a file <code>TestList.java</code>.

 Be sure to test <strong>all</strong> methods and be sure
 to test <strong>all</strong> exceptions for error situations
 as well.

 <strong>You <em>really</em> need to write rock-solid test
 cases for this one. I held back in lecture and provided
 just a few examples, there is <em>much more</em> that needs
 to be tested! Note that I even changed the grading criteria
 to reflect that your test cases are <em>very</em> important
 for this assignment!</strong>
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Please pay <em>extra</em> attention to avoiding
 <em>duplicated</em> code!</strong>
 
 For example, you should have a private method that validates
 incoming positions, you should not repeat the validation code
 eight separate times in each method that needs to perform the
 validation.

 Also many of the <code>insertX</code> and <code>removeX</code>
 methods will rely on code that is incredibly similar, try to
 <strong>factor that code into separate private methods</strong>
 as well!
</p>

<h3>Problem 2: List Reflection (10%)</h3>

<p>
 Your second task for this assignment is to write up a
 <strong>reflection</strong> on the design we've come up
 with for our list abstractions.

 Look at the interfaces, their purpose and interrelation,
 look at our implementation techniques, for example the
 sentinel idea, etc.
 
 Feel free to use other designs you know about (for example
 from the Java class libraries, from a text book, from
 libraries of other languages you know, etc.) to inform your
 critique.

 Your reflection should go into your <code>README</code> file.

 We won't be hurt if you "diss" our design, just be sure
 that you're making a good case that you can back up with
 respectable sources!
</p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<p>
 Please turn in a
 <a href="http://www.gzip.org/"><code>gzip</code></a>
 compressed
 <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/tarball.html">tarball</a>
 of your assignment;
 the filename should be
 <code>cs226-assignment-5-<em>name</em>.tar.gz</code>
 with <code><em>name</em></code> replaced by the first part of the
 email address you used to register on <a href="http://piazza.com/">Piazza</a>
 (so I would use <code>cs226-assignment-5-phf.tar.gz</code>).

 The tarball should contain <strong>no</strong> derived files whatsoever
 (i.e. no <code>.class</code> files, no <code>.html</code> files, etc.),
 but allow building <strong>all</strong> derived files.

 Include a <code>README</code> file that briefly explains what your
 programs do and contains any other notes you want us to check out
 before grading; your answers to <strong>written</strong> problems
 should be in this file as well.
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
For reference, here is a short explanation of the grading criteria;
some of the criteria don't apply to all problems, and not all of the
criteria are used on all assignments.

<strong>Packaging</strong> refers to the proper organization of the
stuff you hand in, following both the guidelines for Deliverables
above as well as the general submission instructions for assignments.

<strong>Style</strong> refers to Java programming style, including
things like consistent indentation, appropriate identifier names,
useful comments, suitable <code>javadoc</code> documentation, etc.
as enforced by <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net/">checkstyle</a>
with our <a href="http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/jhu_checks.xml">JHU configuration file</a>.
Style also includes proper modularization of your code (into
interfaces, classes, methods, and using public, protected, and
private appropriately).
Simple, clean, readable code is what you should be aiming for.

<strong>Testing</strong> refers to proper unit tests for all of
the data structure classes you developed for this assignment,
using the <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit 4</a> framework.
Make sure you test <strong>all</strong> (implied) axioms that
you can think of and <strong>all</strong> exception conditions
that are relevant.

<strong>Performance</strong> refers to how fast/with how little
memory your program can produce the required results compared to
other submissions.

<strong>Design</strong> refers to proper modularization (classes,
public, private, etc.) and the proper choice of algorithms and
data structures.

<strong>Functionality</strong> refers to your programs being
able to do what they should according to the specification
given above; if the specification is ambiguous and you had
to make a certain choice, defend that choice in your
<code>README</code> file.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
If your programs cannot be built you will get no points whatsoever.

If your programs cannot be built without warnings using
<code>javac -Xlint:all</code>
we will take off 10% (except if you document a very good reason).

If your programs fail miserably even once,
i.e. terminate with an exception of any kind,
we will take off 10% (however we'll also take those 10% off if
you're trying to be smart by wrapping your whole program into
a universal try-catch).

Finally, make sure to include your name and email address in
every file you turn in (well, in every file for which it makes
sense anyway)!
